### Pasting Images into Content
Did you know you can paste images from the clipboard into your Markdown documents? You can capture images to the clipboard from any image program, from a Web Browser (copy image), or from a Windows Screen capture (Alt-Prtscreen). Then simply go into the editor and paste. MM will prompt where to save the image and embed it into the document.

### Build your own Markdown Monster Add-ins
Did you know that Markdown Monster has an add-in extension model? You can easily create an add-in that adds custom functionality to Markdown Monster. You can add a button and window using your own UI and/or simply interact with the active document, hook events such when documents are loaded or saved, and modify selected text inside of a document. It's easy to do using the .NET Add-in model.

### Embed Font-Awesome Icons
Did you know you can use @icon-FontAwesomeIconName to embed FontAwesome icons into your content in Markdown Monster? If your target site for HTML supports Font Awesome this syntax is a quick way to embed icons.

<div style="margin-top: 30px;font-size: 0.8em;
            border-top: 1px solid #eee;padding-top: 8px;">
    <img src="https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/favicon.png"
         style="height: 20px;float: left; margin-right: 10px;"/>
